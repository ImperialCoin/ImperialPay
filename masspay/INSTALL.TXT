IMPORTANT

This script is provided as an example tool to show the payment capabilities 
of the Liberty Reserve API. Although this script was tested and proven 
operational, we are not responsible for any loss or damage you might incur 
from using this script. 

Use it at your own risk.

Prerequisites

1. Your web site/server has to support PHP (Apache or Microsoft IIS).
2. This script was tested and compatible with PHP 4.4 and PHP 5.2 or later. 
   You may try to run this script on earlier versions of PHP, but we do not 
   guarantee perfect results.
3. Your server/web site must have domxml, mhash and curl extensions for PHP4 
   or mhash and curl for PHP5.


Installation

1. Backup all files on your web site.

2. To install this script you need to put all PHP files contained in this 
   archive into a separate directory on your web server.

3. Configure your Liberty Reserve Account.
  a. Login to your LR account. 
  b. Click on 'Merchant Tools.' 
	c. Click on 'Create new API.'
	d. Fill in the form. 'API Name' and 'Security Word' are required fields, 
	   which are used to protect your account from an unauthorized access via 
	   API. 'Requesting IP Addresses' is an additional security measure that 
     restricts API access to your account only to the IPs listed in this 
     field. Leaving this field empty will allow any IP to have API access to 
     your account (if they know the API Name and Security Word).
  e. Enter your 'Security PIN' and submit this form. Make sure the API was 
     created and is enabled.
