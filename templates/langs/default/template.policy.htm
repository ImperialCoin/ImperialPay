<i><b>Required Information</b></i><br>To open a <b><?=prntext($data['SiteName'])?></b> account, you must provide your name, company name (if any), address, phone number, home page (if any), and e-mail address. In order to make payments through <b><?=prntext($data['SiteName'])?></b>, you must provide credit card, debit card or bank account information. We may also ask you to choose different security questions to answer. This required information may be necessary for us to process transactions, issue a new password if you forget or lose your password, protect you against credit card fraud and checking account fraud, and to contact you should the need arise in administering your account.<br><br>In order to comply with the Bank Secrecy Act, we will also require your SSN or TIN if you send or receive certain high-value transactions or high overall payment volumes through <b><?=prntext($data['SiteName'])?></b>. If you choose to register or apply for certain optional features or products offered through the <b><?=prntext($data['SiteName'])?></b> websites, you will be required to provide additional information to establish that you qualify for such features or products.<br><br><i><b>Transaction Information</b></i><br>When you use <b><?=prntext($data['SiteName'])?></b> to send money to someone else or request money from someone else, we ask you to provide information related to each transaction, including the amount of the transaction and the e-mail address of the third party. We retain this information for each of your transactions through <b><?=prntext($data['SiteName'])?></b>. We also collect the Internet address (IP address) of the computer or device you use to access your <b><?=prntext($data['SiteName'])?></b> account, in order to help detect possible instances of unauthorized transactions.<br><br><i><b>Information About You From Third Parties</b></i><br>In order to protect all our customers against potential fraud, we verify with third parties the information you provide. In the course of such verification, we receive personally identifiable information about you from such services. In particular, if you register a credit card or debit card with <b><?=prntext($data['SiteName'])?></b>, we may use card authorization and fraud screening services to verify that your card information and address matches the information that you supplied to <b><?=prntext($data['SiteName'])?></b>, and that the card has not been reported as lost or stolen.<br><br>If you send or receive high overall payment volumes through <b><?=prntext($data['SiteName'])?></b>, in some circumstances we may conduct a background check on your business by obtaining information about you and your business from a credit bureau or a business information service. If you incur a debt to <b><?=prntext($data['SiteName'])?></b>, we will generally conduct a credit check on you by obtaining additional information about you from a credit bureau, to the extent permitted by law. <b><?=prntext($data['SiteName'])?></b>, at its sole discretion, also reserves the right periodically to retrieve and review a business or consumer credit report for any account, and reserves the right to close an account based on information obtained during this credit review process.<br><br><i><b>Additional Verification</i></b><br>If we cannot verify the information that you provide, or if you request a withdrawal by check to an address other than your verified credit card billing address, we may ask you to send us additional information (such as your drivers' license, credit card statement, and/or a recent utility bill or other information linking you to the applicable address), or to answer additional questions online to help verify your information.<br><br><i><b>Website Traffic Information</b></i><br>Because of the way that Internet communication standards work, when you arrive at or leave the <b><?=prntext($data['SiteName'])?></b> website, we automatically receive the Internet address of the site that you came from or are going to. We also collect information on which pages of our website you visit while you are on the <b><?=prntext($data['SiteName'])?></b> site, the type of browser you use and the times you access our website.

We do not track the websites that you visit before or after you leave the <b><?=prntext($data['SiteName'])?></b> site.<br><br><i><b>Our Use of "Cookies"</i></b><br>"Cookies" are small files of data that reside on your computer and allow us to recognize you as a <b><?=prntext($data['SiteName'])?></b> customer if you return to the <b><?=prntext($data['SiteName'])?></b> site using the same computer and browser. We send a "session cookie" to your computer if and when you log in to your account by entering your e-mail address and password. These cookies allow us to recognize you if you visit multiple pages in our site during the same session, so that you don't need to re-enter your password multiple times. Once you log out or close your browser, these session cookies expire and no longer have any effect.<br><br>We also use longer-lasting cookies to display your e-mail address on our sign-in form, so that you don't have to retype the e-mail address each time when you log in to your <b><?=prntext($data['SiteName'])?></b> account. In addition, we use cookies to process our referral program, described in Section C below. We may share cookie information regarding whether or not a certain user is already registered with <b><?=prntext($data['SiteName'])?></b> with certain merchants with whom we have an official co-marketing relationship.<br><br><i><b>Customer Service Correspondence</b></i><br>If you send us correspondence, we may retain such information in the records of your account. We may also retain customer service correspondence and other correspondence from <b><?=prntext($data['SiteName'])?></b> to you. We may retain these records in order to measure and improve our customer service, and to investigate potential fraud and violations of our Terms of Use. We may, over time, delete these records if permitted by law.<br><br><i><b>Questionnaires, Surveys and Profile Data</b></i><br>From time to time, we may offer optional questionnaires and surveys to our users for such purposes as collecting demographic information or assessing users' interests and needs. The use of the information collected will be explained in detail in the survey itself. If we collect personally identifiable information from our users in these questionnaires and surveys, the users will be given notice of how the information will be used prior to their participation in the survey or questionnaire.<br><br><i><b>Non-member Recipients and Requests</b></i><br>When a member either sends a payment to, or requests a payment from, an individual who is not a registered member of <b><?=prntext($data['SiteName'])?></b>, we will retain the information that the member submits to us, including, for example, the other party's email address and/or name, for the benefit of the member who is attempting to contact the non-member, so that the member can see a complete record of his or her transactions, including uncompleted transactions. Although this information is stored indefinitely, we will not market to the non-member in any way at any time. Additionally, these non-members have the same rights to access and correct information about themselves (assuming that their email addresses were correct enough to reach them) as anyone else who uses <b><?=prntext($data['SiteName'])?></b>.

Note that law enforcement personnel and other rights holders are given different rights with respect to information they access.<br><b><?=prntext($data['SiteName'])?></b> does not tolerate unsolicited commercial e-mail or "spam". Therefore, without limiting the foregoing, you may not add a <b><?=prntext($data['SiteName'])?></b> user to your mail list (e-mail or physical mail) without their express consent after adequate disclosure, even if said user has previously made a purchase from you.
